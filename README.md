## Introduction

LibJ Net provides supplementary utilities for classes that belong to `java.net` and `javax.servlet` packages.

Java's `java.net` package provides a select range of utility classes, yet many common patterns are left for developers to implement themselves. To bridge the gap, LibJ Net complements Java's standard utility classes with implementations of such patterns.

## Essential Patterns

Please refer to the [Javadocs](https://coveralls.io/github/libj/net);
